/**
 *provide the logical behavior of a "pet" in the game. 
 * 
 * the original idea was something along the lines of having a bunch of floating
 * cat/bunny/puppy/etc heads that made homes in hats. Play on words and all 
 * that, and rather than fully grown cats, they'd be juvenile. 
 * playing up the cute angle.
 * 
 * The development of the idea brought up the possibility of the cats engaging 
 * in different sorts of behaviors. specifically, interacting with each other 
 * as well as potentially the user via interest, affection, curiosity, dislike, 
 * and so on.
 * 
 * preliminary expressed emotions;
 * interest;
 * affection;
 * dislike;
 * curiosity;
 * happiness;
 * sadness;
 * 
 * each instantiated pet unit should also have a slightly different personality,
 * expressing more of some trait and less of others, or veering towards specific
 * preprogrammed or generated behavioral patterns. pattern composition should be
 * used to provide an almost endless variation matrix.
