/**
 *provide the logical behavior of a "cat" in the game. 
 * 
 * the original idea was something along the lines of having a bunch of floating
 * cat heads that made homes in hats. Play on words and all that, and rather 
 * than fully grown cats, they'd be kittens. playing up the cute angle.
 * 
 * The development of the idea brought up the possibility of the cats engaging 
 * in different sorts of behaviors. specifically, interacting with each other 
 * as well as potentially the user via interest, affection, curiosity, dislike, 
 * and so on.
